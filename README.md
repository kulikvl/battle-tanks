## Overview

This is a 2D game written in C++ using the SDL 2.0 library.

> The idea was to make a game in the genre of *Tower Defense* and in the style of the good old pixel game "Battle city" mixed with "Tanki online".

Your task is to hold out as long as possible.

## Installation and usage

[1] Install the repository by forking it and then downloading it using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kulikvl/TowerDefense.git
```

[2] Install dependencies: lSDL2, lSDL2_image

```bash
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
sudo apt-get install libsdl2-image-dev
```
[3] That would build and run the game:

```bash
make run
```

## Code

Things to pay attention to in the project:

* The code is very well documented
* C++17 and C++20 were prefered and widely used (minimum dangerous memory allocations)
* OOP is significantly used (polymorphism and game design patterns)
